Instagram-client
================

An instagram client to upload pictures on Instagram. 

This library is directly inspired from the official iOS Instagram app, by reverse engineering.

Note that this client is for educational purposes only. The key needed to sign the requests has been purposely omitted.

No warrantee nor support is offered for this client.

*DO NOT CONTACT ME. I WILL NOT GIVE ANY SUPPORT NOR THE KEY*


## Install

	python setup.py install

or

	pip install -e git+https://acoomans@bitbucket.org/acoomans/instagram-client.git#egg=Package


## Usage

Before anything, you will need the key and a device id. 
**Do NOT ask me for the key.**

First, import the client:

	from instagram_client import Instagram

Define the key and device id to user:

	Instagram.KEY = "" # do NOT ask me for the key 
	Instagram.DEVICEID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

Now login and upload:

	client = Instagram()
	client.login("username", "password")
	media_id = client.upload('test.jpg')
	
For a picture to be fully available, you need to "configure" it. You can also add a caption during this step:
	
	client.configure(media_id, "My caption")


# Tests

Run the tests with:

	cd tests
	python test.py
